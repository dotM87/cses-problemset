# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) using the Rust programming language.

## Repository Structure

Each problem from the CSES Problem Set is organized into directories corresponding to the different problem categories. Each solution is contained in its own `.rs` file within the respective category.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (installed and configured)
- Cargo (included with Rust)

## How to Run

To compile and run a solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and use `cargo run`:

```sh
